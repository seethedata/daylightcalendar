## [1.1.9.31] - 2026-09-25

Taps on the Settings page could land on invisible parts of closed dialogs. Settings forces its
labels and descriptions to `visibility: visible`, and that also matched the ones inside the closed
Add-profile and Edit-profile dialogs — twelve elements that stayed transparent but caught taps on
whatever lay beneath them, including face recognition's Enroll button. A closed dialog now never
receives pointer events; nothing looks different.

Found by driving face enrolment through the real screens for the first time (it had previously
been tested through the API). Verified afterwards: Enroll -> PIN keypad -> five guided poses saved
in about six seconds; the enrolled face was recognised on the Games tab in three seconds, a stranger
was never chosen in sixty, and the camera was released on leaving the tab. No invisible tappable
elements remain on any page.


## [1.1.9.30] - 2026-09-25

Pantry now opens the receipt workflow on both phones and the wall panel. A camera-first scan control
opens a touch cropper with four large corner handles, honours the photo's orientation, removes the
table or background before upload, and downsizes the result to a model-friendly JPEG. Upload progress,
ten-second queued/reading updates, retryable failures and the model's four-minute expectation remain
visible without letting the Pantry page itself scroll.

Ready receipts open into a phone-sized card review as well as a wide panel review. Printed evidence,
remembered names, quantities, units, prices, categories and parser flags stay visible; included rows,
restored dropped lines and reconciliation totals update together as corrections are made. Confirmation
teaches item memory and plainly notes that it deletes the photo, while corrected CSV export and receipt
deletion use the same saved review. Settings now includes the local receipt reader URL, model name and a
connection check that distinguishes an unreachable reader from a missing model.

## [1.1.9.29] - 2026-09-25

Receipt photos can now be queued for the local Qwen vision model and turned into durable,
reviewable grocery rows without making the wall panel wait for inference. One background worker
feeds Ollama a receipt at a time, survives add-on restarts by re-queuing interrupted work, records
timings and readable failures, and supports retry, row correction, confirmation, deletion and CSV
export. Reader address and model settings live in the persistent add-on data volume and include a
connection/model check.

The parser accepts both the current item-code format and the earlier four-field output, distrusts
unsupported quantities, recovers weights from printed evidence, removes payment, tax, total and
adjacent weight-artifact rows, and reconciles included prices and counts against the receipt. A
confirmed correction is remembered by store and item code (or printed text), so later receipts
start with the household's preferred name and category.

Receipt JPEGs are capped at 12 MB, stay in the persistent private data directory only while review
is pending, and are deleted on confirmation or receipt deletion. Payment/card text is never kept as
an item and is redacted in the dropped-row audit. Verified through the real HTTP API with an
isolated Ollama stub: queued/processing/review state, strict one-at-a-time inference, confirmation
and item memory, garbage and timeout failures, retry, photo deletion and spreadsheet-safe CSV.

## [1.1.9.28] - 2026-09-25

Security update to the add-on's JavaScript dependencies. `npm audit` reported 31 known
vulnerabilities (3 critical, 14 high); after this release it reports none in production
dependencies and 3 moderate ones in development-only build tooling. Twenty production packages
moved by patch or minor versions — notably express 4.21.2 -> 4.22.3, axios 1.9.0 -> 1.20.0 and
ws 8.17.1 -> 8.21.3.

`ws` is now declared as a runtime dependency. The server requires it, but it was listed as a
development dependency, so it only worked because the image installs development packages too;
a production-only install would have crashed the add-on.

Verified on Node 16.20.2 — the exact runtime of the current base image — in a throwaway
container: every API endpoint answered 200 with no runtime errors.


## [1.1.9.27] - 2026-09-25

Hextris is gone from the game library. Its site, hextris.io, no longer exists (the domain stopped
resolving), so its tile opened to an empty frame on the wall panel. It is removed from the defaults
and retired automatically from libraries that were seeded before it died; the clean-up runs at
start-up, before any request can race it.

The Debug tab no longer appears on the family panel. The code revealed it when development mode
was on but nothing ever hid it otherwise, so it showed in production too. It now defaults to hidden
and appears only with `development_mode` enabled — verified both ways.

Also verified end to end in a browser for the first time: tapping a game (the launch target covers
98% of the tile) starts a session, the countdown runs and shows its one-minute warning, and at zero
the game is unloaded, "Time's up" appears, and the server refuses a restart.


## [1.1.9.26] - 2026-09-25

Choosing a player on the wall display still required a tap even though the Dell panel already has
a camera. Face recognition can now be enabled from Settings and enrolled per household profile;
on Games, three clear matches in a row offer to choose that person after a three-second “Not me”
window. Recognition never starts a game, and chores, remaining time, and the one-player limit all
continue through the same screen-time gate. Similar-looking faces must also beat the next-best
match by a safe margin, so uncertainty leaves manual selection in control.

The face library and models are bundled with the add-on for offline use and load only when the
feature actually needs them. Daylight saves no photos or video: only numeric face vectors remain
in the add-on data volume, nothing is sent away from the device, and enabling, enrolling, or
deleting those vectors requires the existing parent PIN and its lockout protection. Camera tracks
stop when Games is left, the page is hidden, a game or modal takes over, or enrollment closes;
permission and model failures fall back to tapping a name without blocking the kiosk.

The “Finish these first” checklist on Games is now functional as well. Its chore rows are large
touch controls that complete the underlying Home Assistant todo item, run the existing star-award
path, and refresh the gate immediately instead of looking tappable while doing nothing.

Two defects were found by exercising the camera pipeline in a real browser with a fake camera feed
before release. TensorFlow.js was never told which backend to use, so on any machine without WebGL
it chose its WebAssembly backend — which downloads its binaries from a CDN, unreachable offline and
through ingress — and every detection failed. It is now pinned to WebGL with a pure-JavaScript CPU
fallback that needs no downloads. And recognition discarded any face the detector scored below 0.8,
but this detector scores a plainly visible face around 0.6-0.85, so an enrolled face measured at
0.685 was never compared at all. The detector floor is now 0.5 (0.6 when enrolling); protection
against choosing the wrong child comes from the match distance, the runner-up margin, three
consecutive frames and the "Not me" button. Verified: an enrolled face matched at distance 0.33 and
was chosen after 3 seconds; a stranger measured 0.70-0.73 and was never chosen in 60 seconds; the
camera was released on leaving the tab in both runs.

## [1.1.9.25] - 2026-09-25

The Games page looked as though it enforced playtime, but its 30-minute balance and every
per-game limit were static labels: the 15:00 overlay never moved, selecting a profile changed
nothing, and a launched game could run without any limit at all. Adding a game also stopped at a
console message, so the library reset to three hardcoded tiles whose artwork depended on dead or
third-party image hosts.

Games now use a durable, append-only session ledger with per-profile daily allowances, parent
grants, server-enforced expiry, and heartbeat recovery that charges only through the last known
play when the panel loses power or the page crashes. Assigned chores that are due now—and,
optionally, today’s routines—must be complete before play begins; the block names the exact work
remaining and a PIN-protected parent can allow one session. The same 4–8 digit parent PIN protects
added time, settings changes, and game removal, with a temporary lock after repeated wrong tries.

The wall display now asks who is playing, shows each person’s remaining time, counts down against
the server while a game is open, stops the iframe and its audio at zero, and keeps the page fixed
to the viewport while only a large library scrolls inside its own bounded area. The game library
persists under the add-on data volume and uses local Material icons instead of hotlinked images;
Screen time settings now include household defaults, individual limits, chore and routine gates,
and a touchscreen numeric PIN pad.

## [1.1.9.24] - 2026-09-22

The week view stopped showing when things actually happen. Fitting the calendar to the panel in
1.1.9.18 also switched the week from a time grid to `dayGridWeek`, which has no hour axis at all —
every event collapsed into a chip stacked at the top of its day, so a 6:30pm parent-teacher meeting
and an all-day trip looked identical and nothing conveyed duration. The week is a time grid again:
events sit at their real start time and span their real length, multi-day events continue correctly
across columns, and all-day items keep their own row.

It still fits without scrolling, which is what the switch had been avoiding. Gridlines are hourly
rather than the 30-minute default, so the 06:00-24:00 window is 18 rows instead of 36 and fits any
panel height; `slotDuration` governs only the gridlines, so events keep exact placement — verified
at 46.4px per hour, with an 18:30-20:00 event landing 580px down and 69px tall. Also adds a current
-time indicator and side-by-side rather than overlapping events.


## [1.1.9.23] - 2026-09-17

The dimmer had been protecting the panel for only 30 seconds at a time, then waking itself back
up to full brightness. At the same time, a wall panel could stay on an old JavaScript page after
an add-on restart, leaving a perfectly healthy touchscreen with nothing current to talk to.

### Fixed
- **Screen protection now stays protective.** After the configured idle period, the full-screen
  dimmer remains in place until the next touch or other interaction, without a countdown, message,
  or precisely targeted wake button.
- **Wall panels now recover after add-on updates.** The page checks the existing configuration
  endpoint for the running add-on version every minute, reloads when that version changes, and
  retries with a bounded backoff through an interrupted restart before reloading once the service
  returns. Reloads defer while a modal or active edit is open.

## [1.1.9.22] - 2026-09-15

The Chores board had reclaimed the page, but the furniture around it had not caught up. Seven
header controls squeezed the title into two lines and clipped the primary New Chore action off
the right edge of the screen, while the household stars strip spent more room on repeated empty
states than on the people it was meant to show.

### Fixed
- **New Chore stays reachable.** The header now keeps Hide Completed, Manage, and the primary
  action visible without a fixed-height clipping point; its controls wrap when space is tight.

### Changed
- **Chore management now lives in one touch-friendly menu.** Rewards, star adjustments, star
  settings, and routines continue to open their existing modals from the Manage menu.
- **Household stars now use full-name profile chips.** The strip no longer carries a decorative
  heading or repeats “No rewards yet” for every family member, and its routine summary can wrap
  instead of running past the edge.

## [1.1.9.21] - 2026-09-15

The Chores board had been squeezed into 22% of its own page by the stars and rewards panels.
Those management features made the actual household work the smallest, most crowded part of a
wall display meant to be read at a glance.

### Changed
- **Chores now leads with the board.** Stars, next-reward progress, and today’s routine total share
  one compact strip, leaving the bounded board the clear majority of the page.
- **Reward management, star adjustments, star settings, and routine setup now live behind header
  buttons and their existing modals.** A profile’s compact reward button still opens the existing
  redemption confirmation before any stars are spent.

## [1.1.9.20] - 2026-09-15

The Chores board could give each lane a scrollbar while the lane itself still extended beneath the
fixed page. That left the final cards and their controls cut off, especially after the dashboard
panels above the board had claimed their space. Each card also repeated a full routine editor,
which made a family board harder to scan from across the room.

### Fixed
- **Chore lanes now receive the bounded remainder of the page.** The frame, content area, board,
  lanes, and lane contents all permit their flex children to shrink; only the lane content scrolls,
  so no card is clipped by an ancestor.

### Changed
- **Chore cards now show compact step progress.** Tapping a card opens the existing modal-style
  detail surface for adding, editing, ordering, and checking off individual steps, while the board
  keeps assignment initials, stars, due dates, and the completion toggle at a glance.

## [1.1.9.19] - 2026-09-15

Version 1.1.9.18 shipped the intended two-bar calendar structure, but FullCalendar could still
render while its frame was hidden and cache a zero-height container. The events and day cells
were present in the DOM, yet the entire visible grid collapsed. The Chores board also made its
new inline subtask controls unreachable when a card grew beyond its lane.

### Fixed
- **Calendar sizing now waits for a visible, non-zero container.** A queued post-activation
  `updateSize()` remeasures FullCalendar after Calendar becomes active, while a guarded
  `ResizeObserver` keeps the grid sized through viewport, orientation, and sidebar changes
  without resize feedback loops.
- **Chore lanes now scroll internally instead of clipping cards.** The board remains
  page-fixed, with token-coloured scroll indicators on each bounded lane so every chore card and
  its add-step control can be reached.

## [1.1.9.18] - 2026-09-15

The calendar had accumulated five competing bands around a time grid that FullCalendar sized to
its content rather than its container. On a 1080p wall display that made the week cut off at 3pm
and required scrolling to see the evening, defeating the purpose of a glanceable family calendar.

### Changed
- **The calendar is now a two-bar, full-height display.** Navigation, the one date title, view
  switcher, and small time/weather readout share a thin top bar; profile chips form the only row
  below it, leaving the grid to use everything else.
- **Week defaults to compact day columns and every event is a solid, contrast-checked chip.**
  Profile star balances now live on their profile chips, so household momentum remains visible
  without a separate panel.

### Fixed
- **FullCalendar now fills its available container rather than growing to its 18-hour content.**
  The page and its glanceable companion pages can adapt to the panel without a page scrollbar.

## [1.1.9.17] - 2026-09-12

The household loop previously stopped at recording stars and rewards on the Chores page. That
left recurring habits, unassigned work, and the daily reason to participate out of sight of the
calendar screen families actually use together.

### Added
- **Up for Grabs, routines, and chore checklists.** Unassigned chores can now be claimed or
  released safely, multi-step routines award once per person per local day, and chore subtasks
  stay beside their Home Assistant todo identity without completing the todo by surprise.
- **A compact, collapsible household-momentum strip on the calendar.** It shows each profile’s
  stars, next-reward progress, routine steps, and available household work, while honestly
  explains when the household has not set those features up yet.

## [1.1.9.16] - 2026-09-12

The chore board previously treated chores as a two-column checklist and then discarded the
assignee and due-date information collected by its own form. That made it impossible for a
child to see ownership, earn reliable credit for work completed outside this screen, or turn
that credit into something motivating.

### Changed
- **Chores now retain household-only assignment, dates, and star values beside their Home
  Assistant todo identity.** Completion awards are an append-only, derived-balance ledger so
  Home Assistant, voice, and wall-panel completions all receive the same idempotent treatment.
- **Stars and rewards are visible on the Chores page.** Profiles can see their current balance,
  progress toward the next reward, and the rewards they can redeem; adults can manage rewards
  and make reasoned ledger adjustments without browser-blocking dialogs.

### Fixed
- **Chore titles could break completion controls or inject markup.** The board now escapes titles
  and uses delegated controls instead of interpolating user text into an inline handler.
- **Lane colours were hardcoded and unreadable in several themes.** The board now uses the
  Material theme tokens shared by all Daylight themes.

## [1.1.9.15] - 2026-09-12

Daylight now has durable household Lists rather than an inert Grocery List modal. Grocery,
to-do, and custom lists persist in the add-on's `/data` volume, report their last successful
sync, and refresh while the Lists tab is visible so a phone and wall display stay aligned. List
writes are serialized before reaching `lists.json`, which prevents simultaneous item adds from
silently replacing each other. Recipe ingredients can now be added to a chosen grocery list;
ingredients already on that list are called out and left unchanged instead of being duplicated.

## [1.1.9.14] - 2026-09-12

The Meal Planner previously presented a convincing but entirely hardcoded sample week: none of
the meals shown came from the household, and submitting the Add Meal form only wrote the entered
data to the browser console before discarding it. Meals and recipes now persist in the add-on's
durable `/data` storage, so planning a meal, changing weeks, editing a plan, and reopening the
Recipe Book all use the data the household actually entered. The Recipe Book's previously inert
controls now create, edit, select, and delete recipes, and a selected recipe can be attached to
a meal plan entry. Grocery-list integration and cooking mode remain intentionally unavailable
until their underlying workflows exist.

## [1.1.9.13] - 2026-09-12

Calendar routing in 1.1.9.12 was only half-shipped: the calendar-management screen rendered
controls for assigning a calendar source to one or more profiles, but the server endpoints those
controls saved to were absent, so every save failed. The routing API now persists calendar-to-profile
assignments and returns the consequence preview's destinations correctly, including shared calendars
that belong to more than one person. Calendars such as Holidays, School, or Birthdays that do not
belong to a person can now be routed to a separately coloured non-person label instead, while
unassigned calendars remain visible rather than silently disappearing.

## [1.1.9.12] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Collapsed sidebar never restored correctly after a page refresh.** Two independent
  implementations were bound to the same toggle element: `initializeSidebar()` in `script.js`
  toggled `#app.sidebar-collapsed`, while `js/sidebar-fix.js` toggled `#sidebar.collapsed` plus
  `.main-content.expanded` and owned the localStorage persistence. On load only the latter was
  restored, so the two states disagreed and the next click drove them in opposite directions —
  which is why collapsing and expanding within one session worked, but surviving a refresh did
  not. `script.js` no longer binds a listener, and a single `applySidebarState()` in
  `sidebar-fix.js` sets every participating class together for both toggle and restore.
- **People filter chips drew stray rectangles around their contents.** `.user-toggle` had three
  competing definitions; the original pinned it to a fixed 36x36 circle, so the initials disc and
  name label added in 1.1.9.11 overflowed that box. Consolidated to one pill definition and
  dropped the `transform: scale()` hover/active rules that distorted it.

## [1.1.9.11] - 2026-09-11

Informed by a Skylight Calendar UI/VOC teardown whose central finding is that profile
(who an event is for), source (where it came from) and destination (where edits write
back) must be visibly separate concepts.

### Changed
- **Profiles now have distinct identities.** Every user previously defaulted to the same
  `#4285f4`, so the people filter row was a line of identical blue circles rendering the
  same generic person icon — there was no way to tell whose filter was whose. Colors are
  now derived from a ten-color palette keyed on the user id, so they are distinct and
  stable across restarts without needing a migration. Filter chips show initials and the
  person's name instead of a generic icon, with 44px tap targets and `aria-pressed` state.
- **Synced calendars are labelled read-only**, in both the calendar management list and the
  event detail dialog. Daylight has no CalDAV write path (`scripts/caldav-service.js` has no
  create, update or delete), so no surface should imply a synced event can be edited here.

## [1.1.9.10] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Recurring events never appeared on their repeat dates.** `parseICalEvent` is a regex VEVENT
  reader with no `RRULE`, `EXDATE` or `RECURRENCE-ID` handling — it emits one event at the
  original `DTSTART`, so a weekly event that began months ago was invisible today. CalDAV queries
  now request server-side recurrence expansion (`expand: true`), which also handles deleted and
  individually-edited occurrences correctly. Falls back to the unexpanded query if a server
  doesn't support expansion.
- **Events appeared to vanish on refresh.** There was no loading feedback, so the gap between
  render and data arriving looked like data loss. Added an "Updating…" indicator via
  FullCalendar's `loading` callback, and existing events now dim rather than disappear while the
  next fetch is in flight.
- **Meal description field overflowed its dialog.** `.meal-input-group` had no CSS at all, so the
  input and "Select Recipe" button laid out at natural width and escaped the 600px modal.

### Changed
- **The Recipe Book is not implemented**, and now says so instead of showing a spinner forever.
  `loadRecipes()` is called in three places but defined nowhere, and there are no recipe API
  endpoints. The "Select Recipe" button, which had no handler at all, is now visibly disabled with
  an explanation rather than silently doing nothing.

## [1.1.9.9] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Only ever fetched 7 days of events.** `/api/calendar` ignored the `start`/`end` the calendar
  view requested; `fetchCalendarData()` always built a fixed today-00:00 -> +7 days window. Month
  view drew six weeks and received one, and nothing before today was fetched at all, so the wall
  display showed far fewer events than the phone. The requested range is now threaded through to
  both the Home Assistant and CalDAV fetches, with a sane fallback and a defensive span cap.
- **Day view was missing**, leaving only Week and Month. Restored to the switcher, the button
  labels and the saved-view allowlist.
- **The calendar never refreshed itself.** Nothing refetched events on a timer, so a wall display
  nobody touches stayed stale indefinitely. Added a 5-minute refresh that pauses while the page is
  hidden, refreshes immediately when it becomes visible, and cannot stack duplicate timers when the
  page loader re-enters the calendar.
- **Tapping an event did nothing** — `eventClick` only wrote to the console. Added an event detail
  dialog showing time, calendar, assigned person, location and description, with touchscreen-sized
  tap targets and theme-token styling.
- **Settings page stretched edge to edge** on a wide display. `.settings-section` and
  `.settings-card` are `width: 100%` with no max-width, so forms had no readable measure. Content
  is now capped and centred, collapsing back to full width on narrow screens.

## [1.1.9.8] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Connected iCloud/CalDAV accounts were wiped by every add-on update.** Accounts were saved to
  `/app/data/caldav_accounts.json`, which lives in the container's writable image layer and is
  destroyed whenever the add-on is rebuilt. Home Assistant only persists `/data`. Account storage
  now uses `/data` in production, matching the `DATA_DIR` logic already used in `index.js`, and
  migrates any accounts found at the old path on first load. User mappings and calendar settings
  were unaffected — they already used `/data`.

## [1.1.9.7] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **Calendar management**: connected calendars (Home Assistant and CalDAV) are now listed in
  Settings with source, color and a persisted enable/disable toggle, backed by new
  `GET`/`PUT /api/calendar-settings` endpoints. Previously calendars could only be reached
  from inside the edit-user modal.
- **Month view** on the calendar page, alongside the existing week view.
- **Per-day weather icons** on calendar days, tappable for condition and high/low. Uses the
  `weather.get_forecasts` service (the `forecast` entity attribute was removed in HA 2024.4).
- **Empty states** for the calendar view and calendar management when nothing is connected.
- **"Next Event" panel is now populated.** `#next-event-info` had no JavaScript writing to it,
  so it permanently read "No upcoming events" regardless of what was scheduled.

### Fixed
- **Connected calendars rendered nothing.** The calendar view dropped every event lacking a
  `userId`, and events only gained one if a person was mapped to that exact calendar. With no
  mappings, all events were silently discarded. Calendars are now visible by default; assigning
  a person is optional and controls color-coding and the people filters.
- **Unreadable CalDAV sync log.** The box was styled inline with `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` and
  `#a1b2c3`, which rendered grey-on-grey on every light theme. Now a token-based
  `.caldav-sync-logs` class meeting WCAG AA across all six themes (4.76:1 worst case).
- **Meals page was squished and unreadable**; rebuilt as a responsive card grid.
- **Theme buttons intermittently stopped responding** after re-entering Settings, caused by
  listeners bound to DOM that the page loader swaps out.
- **Automatic night mode ignored the selected theme**, flipping to generic dark. Pastel, Forest,
  Ocean and Sunset now have hue-preserving dark variants, and auto mode switches between the
  light and dark variant of the active theme.
- **Hardcoded demo users** ("Alex"/"Jordan") removed from the games profile list, chores
  assignee dropdown, meal fixtures, and the unused `--color-alex`/`--color-jordan` tokens.
  These surfaces now populate from real users.

### Development
- Added `mock-data/` fixtures so the `STANDALONE_DEV=true` mode documented in DEVELOPMENT.md
  can actually run without a Home Assistant instance.

## [1.1.9.6] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **CalDAV "Assign to User" dropdown stuck on "Loading users..."**: the call to
  `populateCalDAVUserDropdown()`, along with the `edit-user-form` submit wiring, sat after
  the `finally` block *inside* `handleCalDAVSync()`. Both only ran if the user clicked
  "Sync Now" first, so the dropdown never left its placeholder. Moved into
  `initializeCalDAVSettings()`, which is what the settings-page init already calls and
  whose call site comment already claimed it wired the edit form.
- **Editing a user silently did nothing**: same root cause — `edit-user-form`'s submit
  handler was never attached, so `handleUpdateUser` never fired.

## [1.1.9.5] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **User creation/editing crashed under ingress**: `handleCreateUser` and `handleUpdateUser`
  read `.selectedOptions` from `#new-user-calendar` / `#edit-user-calendar`, but those are
  `<div class="calendar-checkbox-list">` containers filled with checkboxes, not `<select>`
  elements. `.selectedOptions` was `undefined`, so `Array.from(undefined)` threw
  "can't access property Symbol.iterator, items is undefined". Both now read
  `.cal-checkbox:checked`.
- **Empty user list, calendar list and notify-service dropdown under ingress**: 17 `fetch()`
  calls in `public/script.js` used absolute `/api/...` paths. Home Assistant serves add-ons
  from `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/`, so those requests escaped the add-on and hit the
  Home Assistant API instead (401). They now use relative paths, matching the convention
  already used by `page-loader.js` and `populateEditDropdowns`.
- **Socket.io client 404**: `<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js">` was absolute and failed
  to load under ingress in `index.html` and `refactored-index.html`. Now relative.
